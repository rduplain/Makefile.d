This is a repository of useful make includes for runnable projects. Closer to
a cookbook than a package, grab selected files into a project's .Makefile.d/,
`include .Makefile.d/recipe.mk` from the project root Makefile, and add a
.Makefile.d/README.txt file which gives context:

    make recipes based on github.com/rduplain/Makefile.d
